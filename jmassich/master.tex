As long as breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths among female population world wide, developing tools to assist radiologists during the diagnosis process is necessary.
However, most of the technologies developed in the imaging laboratories are rarely integrated in this assessing process, as they are based on information cues differing from those used by clinicians.
In order to grant \ac{cad} systems with these information cues when performing non-aided diagnosis, better segmentation strategies are needed to automatically produce accurate delineations of the breast structures.
This paper proposes a highly modular and flexible framework for segmenting breast tissues and lesions present in \ac{bus} images.
This framework relies on an optimization strategy and high-level descriptors designed analogously to the visual cues used by radiologists.
The methodology is comprehensively compared to other sixteen published methodologies developed for segmenting lesions in \ac{bus} images.
The proposed methodology achieves similar results than reported in the state-of-the-art.
%The achieved results state that the proposed methodology behaves accordingly to the state-of-the-art.

\section{Conclusions}
This work presents a segmentation strategy to delineate lesions in \ac{bus} images using an optimization framework that takes advantage of all the facilities available when using \ac{ml} techniques.
Despite the limitation that the final segmentation is subject to the super-pixels' boundaries, the \ac{aov} results reported here are similar to those reported by other methodologies in the literature.
A higher \ac{aov} result can be achieved by refining the delineation resulting from our proposed framework by post-processing it with an \ac{acm}. In this manner, the contour constraints could be applied to achieve a more natural delineation.
