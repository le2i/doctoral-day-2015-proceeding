\section{Conclusion and future works}\label{sec:5}

In this paper the problem of coverage for video surveillance was show like optimization problem. Random walk and after PSO was using for find acceptable solution and add one more degrees of freedom for have more interesting result. But the experiment show the limit at PSO like the time computation. This limit can be curb and not enough fast for the original goal to create a system of video surveillance dynamic and capable to react despite to the external constraint (real time adaptation).
More the time computation is important and that can limit the application moreover the actual algorithm canâ€™t take into account the obstacle. All this limitation can give some possible future progresses and one of the way to progress is to find some constraint or degrees of freedom like previously the pan. The next step can be to give at the cost function the possibility to manage the multi coverage by zone and add the possibility to zoom.
