A fundamental issue in video surveillance is the coverage problem of the monitored area with respect to the positioning of the camera network. This is a tricky optimization problem which depends on many parameters and which is underconstrained in the general case leading to sub-optimal solutions. In this paper, we propose to adapt a Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to solve it and also to analyze in depth its performances to assess is employability and efficiency. Experiments are performed in simulation in order to provide quantitative results.
