  year = {2015},

  abstract = {The transmission characteristics of millimeter waves (mmWs) make them
	suitable for many applications in defense and security, from airport
	preflight scanning to penetrating degraded visual environments such
	as brownout or heavy fog. While the cold sky provides sufficient
	illumination for these images to be taken passively in outdoor scenarios,
	this utility comes at a cost; the diffraction limit of the longer
	wavelengths involved leads to lower resolution imagery compared to
	the visible or IR regimes, and the low power levels inherent to passive
	imagery allow the data to be more easily degraded by noise. Recent
	techniques leveraging optical upconversion have shown significant
	promise, but are still subject to fundamental limits in resolution
	and signal-to-noise ratio. To address these issues we have applied
	techniques developed for visible and IR imagery to decrease noise
	and increase resolution in mmW imagery. We have developed these techniques
	into fieldable software, making use of GPU platforms for real-time
	operation of computationally complex image processing algorithms.
	We present data from a passive, 77 GHz, distributed aperture, video-rate
	imaging platform captured during field tests at full video rate.
	These videos demonstrate the increase in situational awareness that
	can be gained through applying computational techniques in real-time
	without needing changes in detection hardware.},

	finite-aperture source, we develop expressions relating photon flux
	density within the skin and intensities re-emitted from the skin
	surface to the optical properties of the individual layers. Model
	simulations show that the rate at which re-emitted intensities diminish
	with radial distance away from the source can provide information
	about absorption and scattering in underlying tissues. Re-emitted
	intensities measured from homogeneous and two-layer tissue phantoms
	compare favorably with model predictions. We demonstrate potential
	applications of the model by estimating the absorption ($\Sigma$a)
	and transport-corrected scattering ($\Sigma$s) coefficients of dermis
	and subcutis from intensities measured from intact skin and by predicting
	the magnitude of the optical-density variations measured by a photoplethysmograph.},

	retrieve human skin optical properties using visual reflectance spectroscopy
	(VRS). A three-layered skin model consisting of 13 parameters is
	first used to simulate skin and, through an analytical model based
	on optical diffusion theory, we study their independent effects on
	the reflectance spectra. Based on a preliminary analysis, nine skin
	parameters are chosen to be fitted by GA. The fitting procedure is
	applied first on simulated reflectance spectra with added white noise,
	and then on measured spectra from normal and port wine stain (PWS)
	human skin. A normalized residue of less than 0.005 is achieved for
	simulated spectra. In the case of measured spectra from human skin,
	the normalized residue is less than 0.01. Comparisons between applying
	GA and manual iteration (MI) fitting show that GA performed much
	better than the MI fitting method and can easily distinguish melanin
	concentrations for different skin types. Furthermore, the GA approach
	can lead to a reasonable understanding of the blood volume fraction
	and other skin properties, provided that the applicability of the
	diffusion approximation is satisfied. 漏 2005 Society of Photo-Optical
