Malignant melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer, yet melanoma is the most treatable kind of cancer when diagnosed at an early stage.
In this regard, \ac{cad} systems based on machine learning have been developed to discern melanoma lesions from benign and dysplastic nevi in dermoscopic images.
Similar to a large range of real world applications encountered in machine learning, melanoma classification faces the challenge of imbalanced data. 
This article is devoted to analyze the impact of data balancing strategies at the training step.
Subsequently, an extensive comparison between \ac{os} and \ac{us}, in both feature and data space is performed revealing the fact that \ac{nm2} outperforms other methods achieving \ac{se} and \ac{sp} of $92.50\%$ and $77.50\%$, respectively.
More generally, the reported results highlight that methods based on \ac{os} in data space and \ac{us} in feature space outperform the others.
