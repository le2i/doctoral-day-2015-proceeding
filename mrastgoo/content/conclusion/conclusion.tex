\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:cons} 

In this paper, we analyzed the impact of data balancing techniques for the classification of malignant melanoma. 
Therefore, we presented an extensive comparison of twelve \ac{os} and \ac{us} techniques in both feature and data space. 
These techniques were evaluated on a subset of $PH^{2}$ dataset with an imbalanced ration of 1:3. 
The obtained results particularly highlight the advantage of balancing the training set over using the original data, particularly for the methods based on \ac{os} in data space and \ac{us} in feature space (\ac{nm}).
