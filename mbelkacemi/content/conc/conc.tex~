\section{Conclusion and future works}\label{sec:5}
In this paper, a system based on the \ac{sfh} approach is proposed for detecting non-through defects and fiber orientation. Experiments conducted on steel and aluminum plates showed that non-through defects until \SI{2.5}{\milli \metre} can be detected. On the other side, accurate fiber orientation assessment is achieved with an experimental standard deviation of \SI{0.344}{\degree}. The use of the \ac{sfh} for \ac{ndt} application and the 3D digitization offers the prospect to imagine an industrial system that can give a complete solution for quality control process. 
In future work, we investigate in detecting defects on complex geometry objects. A new calibration method will be also proposed in order to have a dense scan which allows us to merge the provided 3D model with the defect detection information.
