Generally speaking, active thermography approaches use a uniform heating over the entire object-surface with a signal processing based on a 1D model of heat transfer. However, several works tackle this problem using local-based heating.
Burrows et al.\cite{} detect cracks defects on object surface using a laser beam. The heat distribution is disrupted by the crack which modifies the observed hot spot allowing crack detection.
In the case of non-through defects, Hammiche et al.\cite{} make use of a Thermal Scanning Microscope (SThM) where a probe is put into contact with the surface of the sample. Thermal contrast between the excitation and the response of the material is used to build a contrast image at each scanned point of the object.
Along the same lines, Ermert et al.\cite{} develop a non-contact detection approach based on a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The object is excited with a focused and modulated electron beam and the infrared radiations are reflected on a pyroelectric detector. However, the size of the controlled surface is limited.
Fiber orientation can be estimated using technique of pulsed thermal ellipsometry\cite{}. The inspected part is heated by a laser beam and the surface pattern being no more isotropic, the observed thermal pattern become elliptical. The orientation of the fiber is then estimated to be the same than the orientation of the ellipse.
